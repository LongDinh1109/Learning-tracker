## Technologies

### Frontend
- React.js
- Axios for API requests
- Tailwind CSS (optional for styling)

### Backend
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- Dotenv for environment variables

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions
- Render for backend deployment
- Netlify for frontend deployment

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- MongoDB (local or cloud via MongoDB Atlas)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the root directory:
   ```bash
   cd <your-repo>
   ```
3. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm --prefix client install
   npm --prefix server install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create `.env` files in the root, `client`, and `server` directories as needed.
   - Example `.env` for server:
     ```plaintext
     MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
     PORT=5000
     ```

---

## Usage

### Development
Run both the frontend and backend in development mode:
```bash
npm run start
```

### Build and Run
Build the frontend and start the backend:
```bash
npm run build
npm --prefix server start
```

---

## Scripts

| Script              | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `npm install`       | Install dependencies for the root package.       |
| `npm --prefix client install` | Install dependencies for the client.          |
| `npm --prefix server install` | Install dependencies for the server.          |
| `npm start`         | Start both client and server concurrently.       |
| `npm run build`     | Build the frontend for production.               |
| `npm --prefix server start` | Start the backend server only.               |

---

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment
1. Deploy the frontend to Netlify:
   - Ensure `client/build` is built using `npm run build`.
   - Set the `build` directory as the publish directory in Netlify.

### Backend Deployment
1. Deploy the backend to Render:
   - Connect the repository to Render.
   - Set environment variables (e.g., `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`).

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions
1. The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
   - Builds the client and server.
   - Deploys the client to Netlify.
   - Deploys the server to Render.
